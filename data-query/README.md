## Introduction

üëãüèª Greetings, Welcome to the hyper workshops, in the Query workshop, we will
learn about the most advanced features of the hyper Data service. The hyper Data
service is an API or boundary between your business logic and a structured
persistent store. The purpose of this boundary is to isolate the applications
buisness logic which is specific to your application from the data service which
can be a general purpose solution. By creating this boundary, you can rapidly
iterate or experiement with your application in a continuous feedback loop.

Why experiments? Do you every really know what you are building until you build
it? The answer often is "Yes" on the third re-write! üòÉ

In this workshop, We will continue to build out our Mario Wiki API. And we will
showcase the 'query' and 'bulk' functionality of the hyper Data service.

## Prerequisites

What do I need to know to take this workshop?

- HTTP/JSON APIs
- Javascript (async/await promises)
- git/Github (you will need a github account)

> NOTE: We will be using deno a Javascript server runtime for this workshop,
> https://deno.land

---

## Setup

We need to initialize our project, if you have not already, launch this project
in gitpod.io.

- [Launch in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io#https://github.com/hyper63/workshops)
- Setup Local hyper data service:

Login in to https://dashboard.hyper.io and go to your 'mario-wiki-[initials]'
app and copy the connection string.

Create a `.env` file in the `query` folder and add your connection string as a
HYPER env variable:

```
HYPER=[your connection string]
```

üíª In a new terminal do the following:

```sh
cd query
./scripts/setup.js
```

üíª In a new terminal start our API server:

```
cd query
./scripts/start.sh
```

## Query and Bulk

The two advanced commands of hyper's data API are `query` and `bulk`, the
`query` command allows you to create a set of filters for you documents, using
document properties and comparing values. The bulk command allows you to insert,
update, or remove multiple documents in one request.

### Query

As we continue to build our API, we want to provide the ability to find all the
characters that made an appearance in a Mario Universe game. For example, which
characters made an appearance in `Donkey Kong`? In our data store we have
characters and we have games, each of these document types have a unique
identifiers, and we have another document type called `appearances` these
documents contain the game identifier and the character identifier to associate
the characters with the games. Since a character can appear in multiple games
and a game can have more than one character we need a special document type that
maps these associations. In our setup, we created some associations so that we
could get started. In our API, we are going to create a new endpoint
`characters/_query`, when the developer sends a post with a game_id specified,
we will need to return all of the character names for a given game.

- POST /api/characters/_query?game_id=game-1

In the `api/characters/_query.js` file, lets modify the `post` function to
perform this query.

```js
export async function post({ hyper, query }, res) {
  // üìù NOTE: you may want to check if the game_id document exists
  // before running the query.
  const result = await hyper.data.query({
    type: "appearance",
    "game.id": query.game_id,
  }, { fields: ["character"] });

  return res.send(result.docs);
}
```

With `hyper.data.query` we can provide a query object that requests to filter
all documents using the following criteria: the document type should equal
'appearance' and the document `game_id` should equal the `game_id` being
provided on the query string.

#### About the hyper.data.query method

The query method is a powerful mechanism that enables you to write complex
queries using object notation, which makes it easy to construct your filter
using functions.

The method takes two arguments: selector and options

#### Selector

The selector argument is an object that describes how you would like to filter
the store, so if you left it empty `{}` then you would retrieve all of the
documents in the store. If you set it to `{ type: 'character' }` then you are
asking hyper to only return the documents that contain a type property that
equals 'character'. There are several operators that you can use when crafting
your selector.

Basically, when you provide the selector `{type: 'character' }`, you are using
an implicit operator called `$eq` (equals) to instruct the hyper data store how
you would like to filter the documents. `{ type: { $eq: 'character' }}`

> To see more information about selectors
> [Read our docs](https://docs.hyper.io/query-selector)

#### Options

- fields - array of strings specifying the fields you would like to return in
  the results
- limit - number of documents you would like to return
- sort - array of objects specifying the properties you would like to sort on
- use_index - string to specify a specific index to optimize the query.

#### Exercise

Now that we have created a feature to get all the characters by a game id, lets
create a query to get all the games by a character id, in the
`api/games/_query.js` modify the post function using hyper to get all of the
game names and id's by querying the hyper data store.

Test Case:

```sh
curl -X POST localhost:3000/api/games/_query?character_id=character-1 | npx prettyjson
```

### Bulk

Refactor create/update [characters, games]

Lets use the bulk feature to add more characters, games and appearances.

Lets create a new file called `bulk.js`

First, we will need to create an array of objects that would would like to
insert/update:

```js
const data = [
  {
    id: "character-10",
    type: "character",
    name: "Toad",
  },
  {
    id: "character-11",
    type: "character",
    name: "Yoshi",
  },
  {
    id: "character-12",
    type: "character",
    name: "Princess Daisy",
  },
  {
    id: "game-10",
    type: "game",
    name: "Super Mario Land",
  },
  {
    id: "game-11",
    type: "game",
    name: "Youshi's Island",
  },
  {
    id: "appearance-10",
    type: "appearance",
    game: {
      id: "game-10",
      name: "Super Mario Land",
    },
    character: {
      id: "character-12",
      name: "Princess Daisy",
    },
  },
];
```

Now, lets import `hyper-connect` at the top of the file.

```js
import "dotenv";
import { connect } from "hyper-connect";

const hyper = connect(Deno.env.get("HYPER"));
```

And after the data, lets add our code to call the bulk command:

```js
console.log(
  await hyper.data.bulk(data),
);
```

Run it!

```sh
deno -A --unstable --import-map=import_map.json bulk.js
```

Yay! We just inserted or updated documents into our hyper data service.

If you want to delete any documents via a batch you simply include a `_deleted`
flag with the value of `true`.

```js
await hyper.data.bulk([
  {
    id: "appearance-10",
    _deleted: true,
  },
]);
```

This is nice, because if you want to delete some documents, you can compose a
query, then a map function then a bulk.

Here is an example that could be to remove all related appearances when a game
is deleted.

```js
const assoc = (key, value) =>
  (obj) => {
    obj[key] = value;
    return obj;
  };

return hyper.data.query({ type: "appearance", "game.id": "game-1" })
  .then((result) => result.docs)
  .then((docs) => docs.map(assoc("_deleted", true)))
  .then(hyper.data.bulk)
  .then((result) => hyper.data.remove("game-1"));
```

## Summary

In this workshop, we looks at two advanced features of the hyper Data service,
`bulk` and `query`. With `bulk` you can provide an array of documents and the
bulk service can insert, update or remove these documents in a batch process.
Using the `query` method, you can provide complex query filters against your
data store in an object syntax. By combining these selectors you can narrow your
returned list, which can be sorted and only return specific fields in the
documents. The `query` method provides you a rich set of tools to create
specific result sets.
