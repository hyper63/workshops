<p align="center">
Welcome to cache counters, have you ever wanted to display a dashboard of metrics? Great! 
You know a lousy way to do that is to run a query to count the number of some criteria every
time someone would like to see some metrics. A far better approach is to use a cache, the cache 
can be incremented and decremented over time, then when you need to display some numbers, you call
the cache. Noice! ü§ë

## Introduction

The hyper cache is a JSON API that allows you to store JSON data in a key, value store. You can `add`, `get`, `set`, and `remove` key, value pairs to this cache, using `hyper-connect`s cache SDK.

``` js
import { connect } from 'hyper-connect'
const hyper = connect(Deno.env.get('HYPER'))

await hyper.cache.add('key', { value: 1 }, '1h') // here we add a document of {value: 1} to the key 'key' and it will be available from the cache for `1 hour`

```
